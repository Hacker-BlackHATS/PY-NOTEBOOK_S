Model zoos like TensorFlow Hub and Facebook’s Detectron2 make it easy to access popular models. Further, libraries like PyTorch lightning make it easy to then modify these models to suit your needs. This is all well and good for images, but for videos, it’s another story. Video data is becoming increasingly more popular, but the additional complexity that comes with it often leaves video-related tasks on the backburner.\n","\n","PyTorchVideo provides access to a video model zoo, video data processing functions, and a video-focused accelerator to deploy models all backed in PyTorch allowing for seamless integration into existing workflows.\n","\n","The only thing missing from PyTorchVideo to complete your video workflows is a way to visualize your datasets and interpret your model results. This is where FiftyOne comes in. FiftyOne is an open-source tool that I have been working on at Voxel51. It is designed to make it easy to visualize any image or video dataset and explore ground truth and predicted labels stored locally or in the cloud. The flexible representation of FiftyOne datasets and the FiftyOne App let you quickly get hands-on with your datasets and interpret your models to find failure modes, annotation mistakes, visualize complex labels, and more."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-TDYy__tGccj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1623248140256,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5015,"user":{"displayName":"HIMANSHU
