In other words, using data to create models that can predict unknown values. It works by identifying relationships between data values that describe characteristics of something (its features) and the value we want to predict (the label), and encapsulating these relationships in a model through a training process.\\\n","Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis. For example, suppose a university professor collects data from data science students, including the number of lectures attended, the hours spent studying, and the final grade achieved on the end of term exam. The professor could then take a sample of the data and analyze it to determine if there is a relationship between the amount of study a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve. They might use the data to test a hypothesis that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade; or even prepare the data to train a machine learning model that predicts a student's grade based on their study habits."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8pE1W1WpLLrl"},"source":["## Exercise - Explore data ::\n","Data exploration and analysis is typically an iterative process, in which the data scientist takes a sample of data, and performs the following kinds of task to analyze it and test hypotheses:\n","\n","* Clean data to handle errors, missing values, and other issues.\n","* Apply statistical techniques to better understand the data, and how the sample might be expected to represent the real-world population of data, allowing for random variation.\n","* Visualize data to determine relationships between variables, and in the case of a machine learning project, identify features that are potentially predictive of the label.\n","* Derive new features from existing ones that might better encapsulate relationships within the data.\n","* Revise the hypothesis and repeat the process.\n","Data scientists can use a variety of tools and techniques to explore, visualize, and manipulate data. One of the most common ways in which data scientists work with data is to use the Python language and some specific packages for data processing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fw1sl2c4XWOE"},"source":["# Train and evaluate regression models ::"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GOAkb9ovXwv6"},"source":["## Introduction ::\n","Regression is a form of machine learning in which the goal is to create a model that can predict a numeric, quantifiable value; such as a price, amount, size, or other scalar number.\n","\n","For example, a company that rents bicycles might want to predict the expected number of rentals in a given day, based on the season, day of the week, weather conditions, and so on."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dmRtvGuhX5KI"},"source":["## Train and evaluate a regression model ::\n","Regression works by establishing a relationship between variables in the data that represent characteristics (known as the features) of the thing being observed, and the variable we're trying to predict (known as the label). In this case, we're observing information about days, so the features include things like the day of the week, month, temperature, rainfall, and so on; and the label is the number of bicycle rentals.\n","\n","To train the model, we start with a data sample containing the features as well as known values for the label - so in this case we need historic data that includes dates, weather conditions, and the number of bicycle rentals.
